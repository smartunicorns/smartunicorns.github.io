        <center><h1>Greetings, smartunicorns!</h1></center>
        <center><p>You have 3 hours to design a CTF Game. <p></center>
          <br /> <br />
      <p>The guide lines you should probably follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The name should be smartunicorns “foobar”, where foobar is the local name of your game.
        <li>Keep it simple, so you can deploy in in those 3 hours.
        <li>Who said security? Who said anything about the tasks’ contents?
        <li>We should enjoy playing your game, it is a subjective requirement, but guys C’mon!!!
        <li>If you ignore any of the the guideline, you got the freedom but the responsibility too.
        <li>We will play * smartunicrons CTFs in around 2 hours so don’t make hard tasks, be creative and show us how much dope you have
        <li>You should not think we are trying to be cool because we are employing terms such as dope and C’mon.
        <li>You should generate an ssh key and send it to {jedevbien@gmail.com} in the first hour of the challenge, this will allow you to get a free VPS for the rest of the day!
        <li>You should use [https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd] for deploying your CTF on the VPS as we did for the Hackzone!</li>
        <li>You can ask anyone for help, we are a community!</li>
        <li>Again, after 3 hours your CTF should be functional and we should be able to play it!</li>
        <li>Be creative, we do wanna see how creative you can be!</li>
        <li>Do not check if there are any numbering errors, this list numbering is generated on your browser.</li>
        <li>Do you really wanna read every guideline ?</li>
